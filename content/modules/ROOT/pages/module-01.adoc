= Application Modernization and Developer Experience(20 mins)
:imagesdir: ../assets/images/module1

In this module, you will explore the OpenShift Developer experience to understand developers' journey when building new applications and how the OpenShift Application Platform brings developer productivity by reducing complexity and overhead from operations.

== Introduction

In this lab, you will move two applications to OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. Using the Developer Perspective allows developers to move their applications quickly with a click of a button.

In your Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS, you will deploy the rest of the {app_name}. OpenShift already has installed OpenShift Serverless and https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.13/install_config/installing-pipelines.html#op-installing-pipelines-operator-in-web-console_installing-pipelines[OpenShift Pipelines Operators^].

== Application Overview


- *Web NodeJS*: The application recently created is the UI enabling users to interact with the coolstore.
- *Gateway-vertx*: A Java application that works as a gateway between the UI and the rest of the application services.
- *Inventory*: A Java-based application built with Quarkus that provides the inventory information for each specific product. The data is shown in the UI as to how much quantity is available on each product.
- *Catalog*: A Java-based application built with Spring Boot that connects with the Catalog Database to provide all the catalog information. The catalog data will not be visible in the UI without this service.

== Building your first Serverless application with the OpenShift Application Platform
=== Create your project

The serverless cloud computing model provides developers with a modern, cloud-native app dev stack for hybrid clouds. Serverless lets developers focus on their code without worrying about the infrastructure. Red Hat® OpenShift® Serverless allows you to avoid being locked into a single vendor and enables a multicloud approach. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/serverless[More information^]

* Log in the OpenShift using the terminal:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
{login_command}
----

* Create a new project to deploy the {app_name}. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc new-project coolstore-dev-{user}
----

* Clone the project to access the files.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/app-platform.git ~/app-platform
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the catalog and the database.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/app-platform/content/modules/ROOT/files/module-01
----

* Install the the Coolstore components:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f coolstore.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
    deployment.apps/gateway-vertx created
    service/gateway-vertx created
    route.route.openshift.io/gateway-vertx created
    deployment.apps/inventory-quarkus created
    service/inventory-quarkus created
    serviceaccount/catalog-app created
    secret/catalog-database created
    deployment.apps/catalog-database created
    service/catalog-database created
----

=== Explore the topology view
The Topology view in the Developer perspective of the web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the associated components and services.

==== Review the set of microservices that composed the Coolstore application

** Access the OpenShift Web Console

* Obtain the console URL:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
{openshift_console_url}
----
* Copy the console URL in your web browser.

* Use your OpenShift credentials to login in the Web Console.

* user: {user}

* password: {password}

** Click on *Topology* to access the Developer's Perspective

All the components shown are deployments, which are in charge of managing your application. They are all in blue, indicating that the application is running. The arrows will indicate which components are connected.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/odc-viewing-application-composition-using-topology-view.html[For more information^]

As you can see, everything is there except the UI and the catalog. In the next section, you will be moving the UI into OpenShift.

=== Import the application

In this section, you will move the UI source code into OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. OpenShift will create an automated ci/cd pipeline and all the manifests required by the application.

* Copy the Gateway URL to be used in the next task:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get routes
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
    gateway-vertx-coolstore-dev-user2.apps.cluster-kbzn7.kbzn7.sandbox3018.opentlc.com
----

1. Access Developer Perspective by clicking on *Developer* on the left menu.

5. Edit *Import Strategy* and select *Builder Image* (keep Node.js and Builder Image version: 16-ubi8)
6. On Resource Type, select *Serverless Deployment*
7. Click on Advanced options: Deployment and add *an environment variable* to connect with the Gateway URL:

Copy the gateway URL from the route, include https and / at the end. For example:
https://gateway-vertx-coolstore-dev-user2-test3.apps.cluster-kbzn7.kbzn7.sandbox3018.opentlc.com/
Ensure the URL is working before pasting it.

    - *name*: SECURE_COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT
    - *value*: https://Gateway_URL/

*Note*: Revision will be ready once the build process is completed.

* Verify the build process:

1. Click on the *View Logs* on the *Builds* section
2. Verify that the build is running and that the logs have no issues. The log will show *Push successful* in the last line once has finished.

**Notes**: The build might take a few seconds to complete.

image::module1/build_ok.png[width=80%]

Once the Build has finished the application will run successfully.

* Go back to the *Topology view*: Click on *Topology* on the left menu.

image::module1/coolstore_topology_web.png[width=80%]

The application is triggered once the build process is completed. Additionally, the application will restart when it receives any HTTP requests by accessing the application in the web browser.

==== Verify the application is running

* Click on the *Routes* under the Resources tab. Verify that the application is running.


image::module1/coolstore_website_black.png[width=80%]

**Notes**: As you can see, no catalog is available. We need to install the catalog application to access the catalog data.

* Go back to the *Topology view* in the Web Console.

* Explore the application logs by clicking on *View logs* on the *Resources Tab* -> *Pods* section.

*Congratulations* you build and deploy a new application into OpenShift in just a few clicks!

== Building your first backend application using the OpenShift Application Platform with OpenShift Pipelines
In this section, you will move the catalog Java Spring Boot application into OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. OpenShift will create an automated ci/cd pipeline and all the manifests required by the application.

Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html/cicd/pipelines[More information^]

== Conclusion

As a Developer, you can create, build, and manage applications using the Developer Perspective or the command line. The Developer perspective is a powerful tool that enables you to move applications from a Git repository, helm chart, jar file, and much more.
*Serverless* allows the deployment of applications without the burden of operations. The application's pods will be created depending on how much traffic is received. Serverless is a way to save costs since the applications will only run when receiving traffic.
*OpenShift Pipelines* allows teams to build and deploy applications via ci/cd. Pipelines can be autogenerated when selecting the Pipelines checkbox.
