The open hybrid cloud approach enables applications to run anywhere and connect easily using the same tools without compromising security and availability. Decentralized systems are needed now more than ever to reduce latency, improve user experience, resiliency, and reduce costs.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/service-interconnect[Red Hat Service Interconnect^] allows connectivity between clusters, enabling developers to quickly and easily connect their applications without overhead. Red Hat Service Interconnect is based on (https://skupper.io/index.html[Skupper^])


https://www.redhat.com/en/products/edge[Red Hat Edge^] It allows organizations to deploy workloads closer to the end user location, providing flexibility with a right-sized platform. Red Hat Device Edge has many flavors. You will work with the Single Node OpenShift (SNO).

== Pre-reqs:

** Install Red Hat Service InterconnectSI command line (skupper version 1.5.2):

* https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-hello-world#step-1-install-the-skupper-command-line-tool[Install Skupper^]
* https://skupper.io/install/index.html[For Windows and other installation options^]

== A retail use case
In the following example, we will explore a retail use case. Diverse industries can implement this proposed architecture or similar when two services or systems running on different platforms need to connect.

A retail store wants to install an application closer to the end user location to gather inventory information from that particular location.

image::edge_interconnect.png[width=80%]

*Retail Store - Las Vegas*: This retail has a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) already setup.

*Retail Central Hub*: This is an online marketplace hosted on Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS. 


== Introduction

In this lab, you will deploy a service and a database in the Single Node OpenShift (SNO), expose it using Red Hat Service Interconnect to make it available for others.  

In your Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS you will deploy the rest of the {app_name}. The catalog service will connect to the inventory service to gather information about inventory.

== Catalog on Central Hub - OpenShift on AWS

Red Hat Service Interconnect is available through the operator or command line. In This cluster, the operator is already installed.

* Login in the OpenShift using the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p %PASSWORD% https://api.cluster-cluster-ID.opentlc.com:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----

* Create a new project to deploy the {app_name}. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-project coolstore-%USERID%
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the catalog and the database.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd $HOME/app-platform/content/modules/ROOT/examples/module-02
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cat coolstore.yaml
----

* Deploy the rest of the {app_name}, by running the following commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f coolstore.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:

      route.route.openshift.io/globex-ui created
----

* Create an instance of Red Hat Service Interconnect (RHSI).

RHSI is already installed as an Operator at the cluster level. We need to create an instance of this operator in your namespace. We create an instance by creating a ConfigMap with the name **skupper-site**. 

https://skupper.io/docs/declarative/index.html[This  method is called declarative approach^]

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cat configmap_rhsi.yaml
----

**Notes**: The ConfigMap will determine the features available for you. In this case, we enabled **console: "true"** to access the UI.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f configmap_rhsi.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output: 
      configmap/skupper-site created
----

* Verify that all pods are running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get pods -w
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:

----
Note: Wait until all the pods are running, as shown above.

* Create the secret required by Red Hat Service Interconnect to access the current namespace. This token is linked to the secret created recently:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f secret-interconnect.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output: 
      secret/secret-interconnect created
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get secret -o yaml secret-interconnect | yq 'del(.metadata.namespace)' > token.yaml
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
skupper token create coolstore.token
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output: 
      Token written to coolstore.token
----      

* From a web browser, access the {app_name} application using the application route:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get route
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:

----

* On the main menu, select the option **Cool Stuff Store**

image::coolstore-inventoryissue.png[width=80%]


**Notes**: 

The inventory information is missing but the {app_name} website is still visible. Once access to the inventory service this will be resolved. In real situations, we want the {app_name} to be idempotent against losing access to the inventory service/database.

== Inventory on Retail Store - (SNO)

* Login in the SNO using the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p %PASSWORD% https://api.cluster-CLUSTER_ID.opentlc.com:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

*** Click on the service:
 - Throughput Bytes: Charts providing traffic related information

The database will show receiving and sending traffic to the {app_name} site.

** **Components**: Services that are exposed on the service network, both local and remote.

** **Sites**: Application Interconnect installations on the current service network.

Two sites will be visible, from the SNO (retail-location) and OpenShift (retail-hub)


== Conclusion

**Congratulations on finishing this module!**

In this module, you connected two services, one residing on OpenShift on the cloud and the other on Singe Node OpenShift (part of the Red Hat Edge offerings). 

The applications were connected using Red Hat Service Interconnect. RHSI allows connectivity between multiple clusters but also at the edge.
