= Application Modernization and Developer Experience with cloud services (30 mins)
:imagesdir: ../assets/images/module1

In this module, you will explore the OpenShift Developer experience to understand developers' journey, daily activities, and how the OpenShift Application Platform brings developer productivity by reducing complexity and overhead from operations.

== Introduction

In this lab, you will move an application to OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. That's all.  Using the Developer Perspective allows developers to move their applications quickly with a click of a button. 

In your Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS, you will deploy the rest of the {app_name}. OpenShift already has installed OpenShift Serverless and https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.13/install_config/installing-pipelines.html#op-installing-pipelines-operator-in-web-console_installing-pipelines[OpenShift Pipelines Operators^].


== Application Overview

- *Web NodeJS*: The application recently created is the UI enabling users to interact with the coolstore.
- *Gateway-vertx*: A Java application that works as a gateway between the UI and the rest of the application services.
- *Inventory*: A Java-based application built with Quarkus that provides the inventory information for each specific product. The data is shown in the UI as to how much quantity is available on each product.
- *Catalog*: A Java-based application built with Spring Boot that connects with the Catalog Database to provide all the catalog information. The catalog data will not be visible in the UI without this service.

== Building your first Serverless application with the OpenShift Application Platform
=== Create your project
* Log in the OpenShift using the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %USERID% -p %PASSWORD% api.cluster-cluster-ID.opentlc.com:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----

* Create a new project to deploy the {app_name}. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-project coolstore-dev-%USERID% 
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the catalog and the database.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd $HOME/app-platform/content/modules/ROOT/files/module-01
----

* Install the the Coolstore components:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f coolstore.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
    deployment.apps/gateway-vertx created
    service/gateway-vertx created
    route.route.openshift.io/gateway-vertx created
    deployment.apps/inventory-quarkus created
    service/inventory-quarkus created
    serviceaccount/catalog-app created
    secret/catalog-database created
    deployment.apps/catalog-database created
    service/catalog-database created
----

=== Explore the topology view
The Topology view in the Developer perspective of the web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the associated components and services.

==== Review the set of microservices that composed the Coolstore application

1. Access the Developer's Perspective
2. Click on *Topology*

image::coolstore_topology.png[width=80%]

All the components shown are deployments, which are in charge of managing your application. They are all in blue, indicating that the application is running. The arrows will indicate which components are connected.  

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/odc-viewing-application-composition-using-topology-view.html[For more information^]

As you can see, everything is there except the UI and the catalog. In the next section, you will be moving the UI into OpenShift.

=== Import the application

In this section, you will move the UI source code into OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. OpenShift will create an automated ci/cd pipeline and all the manifests required by the application.

1. Access Developer Perspective
2. Click on  *+Add*
3. *Import from Git*
4. Git Repo URL: https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/web-nodejs.git
5. Edit *Import Strategy* and select *Builder Image* (keep Node.js and Builder Image version: 16-ubi8)
6. On Resource Type, select *Serverless Deployment*
7. Select the checkbox: *Pipelines*
8. Click on Advanced options: Deployment and add a variable to connect with the Gateway URL:
    - *name*: SECURE_COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT
    - *value*: https://gateway-vertx-coolstore-dev-user<REPLACEME_USERID>.apps.cluster-<REPLACEME_CLUSTER_ID>.opentlc.com/
9. Click on *Create*

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/creating_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html[For more information^]

==== Verify build and deployment:

1. On the left menu, Click on *Pipelines*
2. Click on the pipelines -> Select the Pipeline -> Pipeline Runs -> Select the Running Pipeline.
3. Verify that the pipeline is running and that everything is green.

**Notes**: The pipeline might take a few seconds to complete.

image::pipelines_serverless.png[width=80%]

Once the Pipeline has finished, it will be shown as Pipeline Succeeded, and Pod will run.

* Go back to the *Topology view*: Click on Topology on the left menu.

image::coolstore_topology_web.png[width=80%]

There is a new deployment object with no pods running. The serverless deployment will be triggered once it receives HTTP requests when accessing the application in the web browser.

==== Verify the application is running as expected

 
* Verify that the application is running on your web browser with the URL:   
https://web-nodejs-git-coolstore-dev-%USERID%.apps.cluster-<>.opentlc.com

image::coolstore_website_black.png[width=80%]

* Verify the pod running

* Explore the application logs by clicking on *View logs* on the Pod section.

image::logs_webui.png[width=60%]

**Notes**: As you can see, no catalog is available. We need to install the catalog application to access the catalog data.

*Congratulations* you build and deploy a new application into OpenShift in just a few clicks!

== Building your first backend application using the OpenShift Application Platform
In this section, you will move the catalog Java Spring Boot application into OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. OpenShift will create an automated ci/cd pipeline and all the manifests required by the application.

1. Access Developer Perspective
2. Click on  *+Add*
3. Import from Git
4. Git Repo URL: https://github.com/coolstore-demo/catalog-spring-boot.git
5. Edit *Import Strategy* and select *Builder Image* (keep Java and Builder Image version: openjdk-17-ubi8)
6. Name: catalog-spring-boot 
8. Select the checkbox: *Pipelines*
9. Click on *Create*


==== Observe the application CPU usage
* In the topology view, Click on *Topology* on the left menu.
* Access the Observe tab.

image::coolstore_topology_usage.png[width=60%]

==== Verify the application is running as expected
* Return to the topology view: Click *Topology* on the left menu.
* Click on the deployment's arrow:
* Verify that the application is running on your web browser
