= DevSecOps with OpenShift Platform Plus (30 mins)

== Introduction


This section will showcase how OpenShift Platform Plus (OPP) can be used to provide a comprehensive DevSecOps workflow, with a focus on Software Supply Chain Security throughout the entire process, from development to production.
DevSecOps stands for Development, Security and Operations, and is a hollistic approach that promotes continous security within your DevOps practices. Our example will highlight capabilities such as defining CI/CD pipelines CD with security gates, image scanning and signing, secure storage in a Trusted registry, and deployment to secured clusters with advanced security monitoring and alerting.


== Application Architecture

The following diagram shows a typical multicluster environment, with a central cluster called HUB, a several clusters covering the different environments from Development to production.

* The first site is the Hub, which serves as the central point for managing and monitoring the cloud-native infrastructure. This is where we will be performing cluster management, advanced cluster security, and hosting a secure image registry, also known as OpenShift Platform Plus (OPP). This is where the DevSecOps pipeline is hosted and run. The developers will be submitting their code builds to the pipeline, and various security tools will be used throughout the pipeline to mitigate the risk of harmful applications or code being deployed in production. The security tools used in the pipeline will be demonstrated as part of the demo, including image scanning and signing, and security gates in the CI/CD pipeline.

* The second site is the Development site (Dev), where a development version of the Globex application will be deployed using OpenShift GitOps (based on argocd).

* The third site is the Secured Production (Prod) site, which is where applications will be securely deployed and monitored. This is the final destination for the applications that pass through the development pipeline and security checks. In this site, we will demonstrate advanced security monitoring and alerting, as well as how to securely manage and deploy applications across multiple clusters.

In our example, and for the sake of simplifying this lab, we will be co-locating the HUB and DEV cluster in the environment that we use.

Let's examine all the components involved in such a DevSecOps pipeline to deploy our e-commerce application named Globex.

== The DevSecOps pipeline

In this section, we will have a look at the end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline and explore the security gates that are provided in it.

* Login to the openshift console using user *admin* and password *{password}* using this URL: https://{openshift_console_url}[https://{openshift_console_url}^]

* In the openshift console left menu, Select the Administrator View, then click on *Pipelines -> Pipelines*, select Project *"ci"*, as shown in the screenshot below.

image::/module3/pipelines.png[width=80%]

*  Select the *PipelineRuns* tab, as shown below.

image::/module3/pipelineruns.png[width=100%]

Let's look why the first pipeline has failed. Click on the pipeline with the failed status. This should take you to the detailed view of the last execution, as shown below:

image::/module3/pipelinerun-error.png[]

The "Log Snippet" section on the bottom-right side shows a quick overview of the reasons why the pipeline has failed. Let's explore more details.

* Click on the failed task named *"acs-image-check"* highlighted in red in the pipeline diagram.

image::/module3/pipelinerun-error-detail.png[]

We can now see that a security policy has failed the check and stopped the pipeline execution:

* *"0-Trusted Signature Policy"*: this means that the container image that has been built hasn't been signed by an appropriate signature, and has a "High" severity, thus it is not trustworty to get into production. This is indicated by the "Breaks Build" column with an "X" mark.

This policy is actually implemented in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS), and the "acs-image-check" task uses the ACS CLI named roxctl to check the validity of these policies for the currently running pipeline. This is how these steps act as security gates that prevent untrusted content to go further away in the pipeline.

== Defining security policies in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (Red Hat ACS)

Now let's have a more detailed look at those policies directly in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security.

* In a new tab, open the Red Hat ACS console at https://central-stackrox.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://central-stackrox.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}^]

* Login as user *"admin"* and password *{password}*.

* Once you are on the Red Hat ACS console, select "Platform Configuration -> Policy Management" from the left-side menu. This should take you to the policies page.

image::/module3/acs-policies.png[]

Red Hat ACS provides about 85 out-of-the-box policies to help implement security best practices and sageguards across your fleets of clusters, you can explore some of them by scrolling through the list of policies.

* Let's now look at the "Trusted Image Signature" policy that was triggered in the pipeline previously. In the "Filter policies" section, type "Policy" then hit enter, then type "Trusted Signature".

image::/module3/acs-trusted-signature-policy.png[]

* Click on the policy to check its details, then select "Actions -> Edit Policy" on the top right side.

image::/module3/acs-edit-policy.png[]

On the "Policy Details", you can define the metadata and the Severity level and some other information. 

Next, select the "Policy Behavior" and this is where you can define when and how the policy gets applied.

image::/module3/acs-policy-details.png[]

The "Lifecycle stages" allow you to define if it's applied at Build, Deploy or Runtime.

The response method provides 2 options:

* *Inform*: the policy only triggers an alert but is not enforced, meaning it takes no specific action.
* *Inform and enforce*: The policy triggers an alert AND is enforced, for example deleting a container that violates a specific policy, or in our previous case by breaking the pipeline because the container image was not signed with a trusted signature.

Finally, the "Configure enforcement behavior" gives you control over how the policy gets enforced, as explained in the different options.

* Next, click on "3-Policy criteria" to explore how the signature verification is implemented. Inside the "Policy Section 1", click on "Select".

image::/module3/acs-policy-criteria.png[]

* In the pop-up, click on "cosign", and this will take you to the public signature that is used to verify the container image, in pair with the private signature that is used by OpenShift Pipelines / Tekton Chains to sign the container images after the build. We will talk about the image signing process in more details in the next pipeline.

image::/module3/acs-signature-integration.png[]

Let's now see how Red Hat ACS allows you to monitor your cluster security, by inspecting image vulnerabilities.

* On the left-side menu, click on "Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard", then select images on the top-right side

image::/module3/acs-vuln-management.png[]

* On the filter section, type "Image" then hit enter, then type "globex-ui:main", and select the one with an "active" image status

image::/module3/acs-image-cves.png[]

This will take you to the image details, where you see a listing of all CVEs, all components, and all the deployments that are using this image on the right side panel. This helps you mitigate issues when there's a compromised image for example.

image::/module3/acs-image-details.png[]

That's it! You now have a better understanding of how Red Hat ACS allows you to define security policies that can in turn be used within the DevSecOps pipeline as security gates to prevent untrusted / undesirable content from getting into your production environments, and also continuous monitor the security of your multiple clusters and applications across all environments.


== The advanced DevSecOps pipeline - in-depth look

Now that we are familiar with how the previous pipeline was integrated with Red Hat ACS to implement security gates, let's have a look at the more advanced devsecops pipeline called "app-globex-ui-pipeline".

* Go back to the OpenShift Console: https://{openshift_console_url}[https://{openshift_console_url}^]

* From the left side menu, select Pipelines -> Pipelines. In the right-side window, select the "PipelineRuns" tab and click on the pipelineRun with a "Succeeded" status.

image::/module3/advanced-devsecops-pipelinerun.png[]

This will take you to a diagram with the last pipeline execution. Let's now examine the different steps, and focus on the tasks that provide an extra layer of security.

image::/module3/pipeline-group-1.png[]

In the early stages of the pipeline, we do a traditional source clone, then we verify the code using SonarQube and verify the source code commits, to make sure the code is legitimate.

Now, in the next stages, this is where we have implemented additional security layers that will be detailed below.

image::/module3/pipeline-group-2.png[]

* *"Build-image"*:

Enhancing Security with Tekton Chains

This task is responsible for building a container image based from our source code, including any changes that were committed. The built container image, along with a new tag and a generated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is then pushed to our private quay registry on successful completion. An SBOM is a machine-readable, formally structured complete list of all the components, including modules and libraries, used/required to build a software solution. So, in simple words, a software bill of materials offers an insight into the makeup of an application developed using third-party commercial tools and open-source software.

This task also uses Tekton Chains, a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller, that is crucial in augmenting the supply chain security within our OpenShift Pipelines. This tool’s capacity to automatically sign task runs, and its adoption of advanced attestation formats like in-toto, bring a higher degree of trust and verification to our processes.

This task is responsible for emitting two important TaskResults i.e. IMAGE_URL and IMAGE_DIGEST. Those parameters are very important because they are the ones that trigger Tekton Chains to create a digital signature for your container image.

Now let's have a look at the following tasks:

image::/module3/pipeline-group-3.png[]

* *acs-image-check*: this task uses the roxctl CLI to check build-time violations of your security policies in your image. In this demo, we have set up a policy that verifies signatures on your container image. If this policy is enabled and your container image is unsigned or signed by non trusted source, the pipeline will fail. If the signature is available and is trusted, this pipeline task will complete successfully.

* *acs-image-scan*: The acs-image-scan uses the roxctl CLI to return the components and vulnerabilities found in the image . Any vulnerabilities that exist in packages embedded in the image will be reported.

* *scan-export-sbom*: This task is responsible for scanning any vulnerabilities that exist in our SBOM and exports our SBOM to a externally accessible repository. For scanning, this task uses a 3rd-party tool called Grype which is a vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems.

* *acs-deploy-check*: This task uses the roxctl CLI to check the deployment YAML files for any security issues or bad practices, such as running a container image as root, or not defining health checks etc. It scans the YAML file that is stored in the git repository and used for a gitops approach to deploy the application. We will talk about this in the "Adopting a GitOps approach for deployments across multiple clusters" section.

That's it! You now have a deeper understanding of the Security capabilities that provide a Trusted Software Supply Chain (or DevSecOps approach), using OpenShift Pipelines (tekton chains), and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (Red Hat ACS).


== Using a Trusted image registry to store signed images

Red Hat Quay is a trusted, geo-replicated, security enabled container registry that allows to scan container image for vulnerabitilies, but also store the signed images with all their metadata, such as the generated SBOM files and the signatures. These assets can be used later on in the pipelines for verification and validation purposes, like we have seen in the previous pipeline.

Let's now have a look at container image in Quay, and verify that it has indeed been signed by the pipeline.

* In a new tab, Open the Quay URL: https://quay-{guid}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://quay-{guid}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}^]

* Login as user *"quayadmin"* and password *{password}*. Next, click the *"quayadmin/globex-ui"* repository, and click on 'Tags' on the left side menu

image::/module3/quay-tags.png[]

We can now see all the history of that container image, with all tags, and the associated metadata. We can particularily see that this container image has a small checkmark next to it, hover it to check that it has been correctly signed by Tekton Chains with the DevSecOps pipeline was last run. 

You can also click on the *"Show signatures"* button on the top-right side to reveal additional information about the image.

image::/module3/quay-image-signed.png[]

Quay also provides a summary of the vulnerabilities of the container image, but since we've already seen that with Red Hat ACS, let's skip to the next section.

That's it, you now have a better understanding of Quay capabilities to store the signed container images, along with the metadata such as SBOMs, signatures etc.

== Adopting a GitOps approach for deployments across multiple clusters

As mentioned in the application architecture section, in a typical multicluster scenario, our "Globex" application would be deployed across multiple clusters using a OpenShift GitOps (based on argocd). There is one argocd instance per cluster, and a shared gitops repository that contains the deployment manifests (yaml files), that gets updated by the pipeline whenever there is a new update to the soure code.

Let's explore this step in the pipeline, then have a look at argocd to understand how it uses the manifests to target the desired cluster.

* On the OpenShift console, on the left menu, Select Pipelines -> Pipelines, and select the pipelineRun with the "Succeeded" status (the same one as in the previous section).

image::/module3/pipeline-group-4.png[]

* *update-dev-manifest*: This task is responsible for updating the manifests in the git repository, by updating the container image reference in the deployment yaml file, using Kustomize. This is a standard approach when using tools like OpenShift GitOps (based on argocd). Let's have a look at the yaml file in Gitea.

* In a new tab, open Gitea's URL: https://gitea.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://gitea.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}^]

* Login using the provided credentials: username: *dev-user*, password: *openshift*.

* Click on the last commit id, as shown in the screenshot below:

image::/module3/gitea-commit-id.png[]

* Take a look at the changes about the container image tag, as seen below. Because OpenShift GitOps is constantly monitoring that GitOps repository, any update to the yaml file triggers a reconciliation with the target DEV cluster, meaning the application gets redeployed.

image::/module3/gitea-updated-manifest.png[]

Let's now switch to OpenShift GitOps to see how the application gets deployed in the DEV cluster using argocd.

* Open the OpenShift GitOps URL: https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}^]

* Login as user *"admin"* with password *{password}*

* OpenShift GitOps uses a concept of an *"Application"* as a group of manifests stored in a git repository that need to be deployed altogether. Select the "Globex" application in the main page to access the details.

image::/module3/gitops-application-globex.png[]

* On the top-left side, click on *"App details"* to access the information about the application, such as the git repository, the branch where the files are located, the target cluster and namespace where the application is deployed, etc.

image::/module3/gitops-app-details-more.png[]

* Close the application details window, and explore the application page to see all the kubernetes resources that are deployed by OpenShift GitOps to the target cluster / namespace, such as the deployments, the services, etc.

* Let's see the same resources deployed in the application namespace *"globex"* with this URL: https://{openshift_console_url}/topology/ns/globex?view=graph[https://{openshift_console_url}/topology/ns/globex?view=graph^]

image::/module3/globex-app.png[]

* Let's open the application to verify that it is running as expected: https://globex-ui-globex.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/products[https://globex-ui-globex.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/products^]

image::/module3/globex-ui.png[]


That's it, you now have a better understanding of how the DevSecOps pipeline is combined with OpenShift GitOps for a multicluster deployment of the "Globex" application. 


== Summary

Here a quick summary of all you've seen in this lab:

* OpenShift Platform Plus provided is a comprehensive solution that provides multicluster management (RH ACM, not seen in the lab), continuous security (Red Hat ACS) and a Trusted Registry (Red Hat Quay) that serve as a great foundation to implement a Trusted Software Supply Chain and adopt a DevSecOps approach.

* OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton) offers advanced CI/CD capabilities, and allow a direct integration with RH ACS to implement a DevSecOps approach. It also provides advanced capabilities like image signing through the Tekton Chains controller.

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security offers out-of-the-box security capabilities such as security policies and image scanning for vulnerabilities to a continuous security monitoring across all your clusters.

* OpenShift GitOps (based on argocd) allows you to adopt a GitOps approach to deploy your application across different environments and multiple clusters, from development to production and all intermediate stages.
