The open hybrid cloud approach enables applications to run anywhere and connect easily using the same tools without compromising security and availability. Decentralized systems are needed now more than ever to reduce latency, improve user experience, resiliency, and reduce costs.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/service-interconnect[Red Hat Service Interconnect^]    allows connectivity between clusters, enabling developers to quickly and easily connect their applications without overhead.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/device-edge[Red Hat Device Edge^] It allows organizations to deploy workloads closer to the end user location, providing flexibility with a right-sized platform. Red Hat Device Edge has many flavors. In this lab, you will work with an Single Node OpenShift (SNO).


== A retail use case
In the following example, we will explore a retail use case. Diverse industries can implement this proposed architecture or similar when two services or systems need to connect where they reside on different platforms/networks.

A retail store wants to install an application closer to end user location to gather inventory information from that particular location.

*Retail Store - Las Vegas*: This retail has a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) already setup.

*Retail Central Hub*: This is an online marketplace hosted on Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS. 


== Introduction

In this lab, you will deploy a database in the Single Node OpenShift (SNO), expose it using Red Hat Service Interconnect to make it available to others to connect it.  In your Red Hat OpenShift running on AWS you will deploy a backend service that will connect to the database to gather information about inventory.

== Catalog on Central Hub - OpenShift on AWS

Red Hat Service Interconnect operator is already installed.

* Login in the OpenShift using the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift 
----

* Create a new project to deploy the coolstore online marketplace, *catalog*. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-project coolstore-%USERID%
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the catalog and the database.
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
$ cd $HOME/app-platform/content/modules/ROOT/examples/module-02
$ cat coolstore.yaml
----


* Deploy the catalog by running the following commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f coolstore.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
      serviceaccount/catalog-app created
      secret/catalog-database created
      deployment.apps/catalog-database created
      service/catalog-database created
      deployment.apps/catalog created
      service/catalog created
      route.route.openshift.io/catalog created
      secret/order-placement created
      serviceaccount/order-placement created
      deployment.apps/order-placement created
      service/order-placement created
      serviceaccount/globex-app-globex-ui created
      deployment.apps/globex-ui created
      service/globex-ui created
      route.route.openshift.io/globex-ui create
----

* Create the secret required by Red Hat Service Interconnect to access the current namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f secret-interconnect.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output: 
      secret/secret-name created
----

$ oc get secret -o yaml secret-name | yq 'del(.metadata.namespace)' > token.yaml

* From a web browser, access the coolstore application using the application route:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
$ oc get route
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output: 
      NAME        HOST/PORT                                                    PATH   SERVICES    PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
      ....
      globex-ui   globex-ui-demo.apps.cluster-hpxfn-1.sandbox933.opentlc.com          globex-ui   http   edge/Redirect   Non
----

**Notes**: 

The inventory information is missing but the {app_name} website is still visible. Once access to the inventory database this will be resolved. In real situations, we want the {app_name}  to be idempotent against losing access to the inventory database.

== Inventory Database on Retail Store - (SNO)

* Login in the SNO using the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login -u %USERID% -p openshift 
----

* Create a new project to deploy the PostgreSQL database, *inventory*. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-project inventory-%USERID%
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the database.
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
$ cd $HOME/app-platform/content/modules/ROOT/examples/module-02
$ cat inventory-all.yaml
----

* Deploy the inventory database and backend service by running the following commands in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
$ oc apply -f inventory-all.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
      serviceaccount/inventory-app created
      secret/inventory-database created

** Topology: Graphical representation of all the connections
** Addresses:


image::rhsi_addresses.png[width=80%]

*** Click on the service:
 - Throughput Bytes: Charts providing traffic related information

The database will show receiving and sending traffic to the {app_name} site.

image::rhsi_traffic.png[width=80%]


** Components: Services that are exposed on the service network, both local and remote.

** Sites: Application Interconnect installations on the current service network.

Two sites will be visible, from the SNO (database) and OpenShift (coolstore)
