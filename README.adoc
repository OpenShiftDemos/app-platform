=== Getting Started

. Create a git repo from this template
. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
. Run ./utilities/lab-serve
. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
. Run ./utilities/lab-build to build your html

Your lab should now update and on day 1 will look more or less like this:

image::.images/lab-image.png[Lab Image]

Now you are ready to go!  You can start editing the files in the `content/modules/ROOT/pages/` directory.

**Today** you have to run `./utilites/build` to rebuild your html but *very shortly* we will be adding live updating.
I.E. on every save the lab will re-build in real time.
In addition, many modern editors such as Visual Studio Code offer live Asciidoc Preview extensions.

=== Understanding the Basic Template Directory Structure

[source,sh]
----
./content/modules/ROOT/
├── assets
│   └── images                       # Images used in your content 
│       └── example-image.png
├── examples                         # You can add downloadable assets here 
│   └── example-bash-script.sh       # e.g. an example bash script
├── nav.adoc                         # Navigation for your lab
├── pages                            # Your content goes here
│   ├── index.adoc                   # First page of your lab, e.g. overview etc 
│   ├── module-02.adoc
│   └── module-03.adoc               # Sample lab has 3 modules including index.adoc
└── partials                         # You can add partials here, reusable content inserted inline into your modules
    └── example_partial.adoc
----

=== Development Cycle

. Edit your content in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
. Run `./utilities/build` to build your html
. Use `git` to branch and commit your work
. Push your work to your repo
.. You should use `git tags` or `git branches` in production
.. However development items default to the head of `main`

=== Configuring your Lab 

Project Zero Lab repos have 3 *yaml* files that control the build and deployment of your lab.
However _typically_ you will only need to only make very few edits 

[source,sh]
----
├── content
│   └── antora.yml                  # You can add "inline vars" here to render within your content
├── zero-touch-config.yml            # 
└── zero-touch-site.yml
